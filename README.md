This problem may be familiar to every programmer: You can illustrate what you try to achieve using an example, and you remember that there was some function doing exactly this - you just absolutely cannot remember how this function is called. In this situation, the JavaScript method finder is precisely what you are looking for.

# Usage

Go to [https://bewee.github.io/js-method-finder](https://bewee.github.io/js-method-finder). Enter some sample input values together with the expected output value, click on "Find" and voil√†.

As an example, I may want to retrieve the next 2 characters which come after the first character of a string. Entering the expected output for a sample yields the required method.
